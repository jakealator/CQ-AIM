% Tests that the program generateTriangleAreas.m works correctly by checking
% if a few specially chosen triangle areas are computed correctly.

% Need to create a struct with the appropriate information in order to
% test. 

% Three triangles at: (0,0)--(1,0)--(0,1) [area = 
trisVals = [[1,2,3];[2,3,4];[4,1,5]];
nodeVals = [[0,0];[1,0];[0,1];[0,-1];[-1,0]];
nt = 3;

meshStruct = struct('nt',nt,'tris',trisVals,'nodes',nodeVals);

triangleAreas = generateTriangleAreas(meshStruct,3);
