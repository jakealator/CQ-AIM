% Generates auxillary parameters needed for frequency domain AIM. In
% particular, given a finite element mesh, code gives triangle centroids,
% triangle areas, and h-parameter. A far field grid is also generated;
% assume finite element grid is contained in a ball of radius r. The grid
% contains 4r. Spacing of grid is dictated by h and by the parameter M, the
